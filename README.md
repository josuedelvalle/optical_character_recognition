# OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using Pillow and Tesseract

This repository provides a comprehensive OCR (Optical Character Recognition) solution implemented using two powerful libraries, Pillow and Tesseract. The aim of this project is to enable accurate and efficient extraction of text from images or scanned documents.

### Features:

1. **Image Preprocessing:** The project utilizes the functionalities of Pillow, a widely-used Python imaging library, to preprocess the input images. This includes operations such as resizing, cropping, rotation, and enhancement to optimize the image for OCR processing.

2. **Text Extraction:** Tesseract, an open-source OCR engine, is integrated into the project to perform the actual character recognition. It supports a wide range of languages and provides robust text extraction capabilities. The repository includes code snippets and examples to demonstrate the integration and usage of Tesseract with Python.

3. **Customization and Fine-tuning:** The OCR solution can be customized and fine-tuned according to specific requirements. Parameters such as language selection, text orientation, and noise reduction techniques can be adjusted to achieve optimal results. The repository provides guidelines and best practices for effectively tweaking these parameters.

### Contributions and Feedback:
Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are highly encouraged. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your feedback plays a vital role in the development and enhancement of this OCR repository.
